## Dataset Limitations

Data source unknown - data collected from multiple sources cany vary by quality and format.  

With 4114 campaigns, some data subsets (Countries, Categories, Sub Categories) may have low sample sizes and must exercise caution when drawing conclusions and insights from only a few data points. 

## Further Analysis 

Additional analysis could include comparison of Outcomes by Parent Category and/or Sub Category for additional insights.  Could also include Outcomes by Country.
