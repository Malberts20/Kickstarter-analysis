# Kickstarting with Excel

## Overview of Project

Provide recommendations for client (Louise, playwright) through analysis of prior crowdsourcing campaigns.

### Purpose

Client is interested in starting a crowdfunding campaign (budget is $10,000) for her new play, Fever.

## Analysis and Challenges

Data file for prior crowdfunding campaigns included description, funding goal, amount pledged, country, deadline date, launch date, number of backers, category, and sub-category  of 4114 campaigns.

Analysis focused on analyzing Outcomes (success, failed, canceled, or live) based on Launch Date and Outcomes Based on Goals for the play sub-category. 

### Analysis of Outcomes Based on Launch Date

### Challenges and Difficulties Encountered

Data Format for deadline and launch date required conversion for analysis.  Format conversion accomplished with formula.

### Results

## Conclusions - Outcomes based on Launch Date

1.  May followed by June then July have the highest success for crowd funding campaigns.
2.  Successful campaigns illustrate highest variance with beginning and end of year at lowest success rate.

Recommendation:  Crowdfunding campaign should be launched in late spring/early summer months with May as target month followed by June and July - would not recommend launching beyond July for best outcome.

## Conclusions - Outcomes based on Goals

1. Campaigns with goals less than $5000 show highest success rate followed by campaigns with goals up to $15000.

Recommendation:  For the client's $10,000 budget, recommend launching two (2) separate campaigns of $5,000 each to maximize probability of success.

## Dataset Limitations

Data source unknown - data collected from multiple sources cany vary by quality and format.  

With 4114 campaigns, some data subsets (Countries, Categories, Sub Categories) may have low sample sizes and must exercise caution when drawing conclusions and insights from only a few data points. 

## Further Analysis 

Additional analysis could include comparison of Outcomes by Parent Category and/or Sub Category for additional insights.  Could also include Outcomes by Country.
